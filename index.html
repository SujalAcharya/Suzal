        Dashain is a festival originating from 
         Nepal. In parts of India, it is called Dashera. 
         Dashain is celebrated by the Hindus of Nepal and the 
         Nepali language speaking Indian Gorkhas of Darjeeling hills, Sikkim, 
         Assam and other North-Eastern states of India
        and among the Lhotshampa of Bhutan and the Burmese Gurkhas of Myanmar.

        It is the longest and the most auspicious festival in the Bikram Sambat and Nepal Sambat annual calendars, celebrated
         by Nepalese people, along with their diaspora throughout the globe. It is the most anticipated festival in Nepal, Bhutan,
          Burma, and North Indian hills.
         People return from all parts of the world, as well as different parts of the country, to celebrate together. 
        All government offices, educational institutions and other offices remain closed during the festival period. The festival 
        falls in September 
        or October, starting from the shukla paksha (bright lunar fortnight) of the month of Ashwin and ending on Purnima, the
         full moon.
         Among the fifteen days on which it is celebrated, the most important days are the first, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth
          and the fifteenth.

        Among the Newar of the Kathmandu Valley, during the Dashain festival, popular Newari festival called Mohani,
         is celebrated as the most important festival of Nepal Sambat calendar year. Among Hindu and Buddhist Newars,
          it is celebrated differently, where each nine days Navaratri (Nepal Bhasa: नवरात्री) leading up to the 10th day called 'Dashami',
           carry special importance. The goddess Durga and her various manifestations are especially worshiped by Hindu Newars throughout 
           the Shaktipeeths of Kathmandu Valley. Among Newars, Dashain is also important for its emphasis on family gatherings as well as on
            a renewal of community ties, highlighted by special family dinners called Nakhtyā (Nepal Bhasa: नख्त्या)
         and various communal processions of deities called Jātrā (Nepal Bhasa: जात्रा) throughout the three royal cities of Kathmandu Valley.
